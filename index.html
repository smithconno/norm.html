<h1>
Norms and Exceptions </h1>
<p>
When someone finds patterns and trends lurking in the data and then observes the deviations from those patterns, they can find interesting stories based off of the norms and exceptions. Norms can be described as the data in a data set that is closely packed together while exceptions are the outliers from that data set. For example, if a teacher made a graph displaying a class set of test grades on one certain test they will be able to see the norms and exceptions in the graph. The norms would be the grades which were the most common, and the exceptions would be the grades that are as far from the norms as possible. The exceptions can be outliers in a good way or bad way it just depends on the data set.
